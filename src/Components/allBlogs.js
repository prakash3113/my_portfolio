The knowledge of programming and coding is the most basic and essential skill thatâ€™s required by every individual who wants to make a mark in this field. Simply put, computer programming and coding are the processes of creating instructions for the computer to perform its tasks. Youâ€™ll have to learn at least one programming language to start in the field. These languages include C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, and Python to name a few. However, if you want to go far as a software engineer, you should know numerous languages. In fact, youâ€™ll want to master at least two languages if you really want to stand out. There are invaluable software tools that are meant to help managers prioritize their project deliverables. There are also a lot of tools for developers and software engineers to write code efficiently. With that being said, you need to know and be thoroughly well-versed in the tools that are used by most software engineers. This will make your professional journey super smooth.'

Itâ€™s a complex language, so before you invest your time and money in learning JavaScript, youâ€™ll need a clear rationale as to why itâ€™s necessary for your career path. If youâ€™re certain itâ€™s a skill youâ€™ll need in your arsenal, youâ€™ll then need to decide on the appropriate learning option. Should you go for a degree or the less formal route of online certifications and bootcamps? Or will you go it alone and brave independent self-learning? Letâ€™s take a closer look at each option to help you find out. When it comes to learning JavaScript, there are multiple modes through which you can educate yourself. Depending on where you are in your career, you can pick a path that suits you best.'

Once youâ€™re up and running, youâ€™ll be able to create sections and paragraphs, structure them, add headings and links, and ultimately create an entire web page - one bracket at a time. A web developer can do a lot with HTML, but itâ€™s important to remember itâ€™s not a programming languageâ€”you canâ€™t use it to create dynamic functionality. Simple code structures like tags and attributes are used while working with HTML to mark-up a webpage or document. For instance, if you want to create a paragraph using HTML, you place your text within a beginning <p> and a closing </p> tag. The same process is repeated to formulate subsequent paragraphs in the document. The tags that go into building a page are also referred to as elements, and are seen as the building blocks of webpages.'

        desc: 'By now youâ€™ve probably heard of a few template-based web building platformsâ€”like Squarespace, Wix and Weeblyâ€”that have made it much easier for those with no web development experience to create a fully functioning website. These platforms are often used by web developers too, when theyâ€™re looking to build a site for a client on a budget or with simple functionality requirements. This might leave you wondering if HTML and CSS will be made redundant in the years to come. There are a few reasons why thatâ€™s not going to happen anytime soon. First of all, templates and pre-fabricated websites offer a limited selection to choose from, that may not always match your clientâ€™s vision for a website. Thereâ€™s little creativity being used while dragging and dropping elements onto a web page, which is one of the limitations of using these platforms. If a client requires a higher level of customization and uniqueness, and you try to rely on one of these platforms, you could end up disappointing the client.'

Devices such as smartphones, tablets, and smart TVs are changing the way we connect with one another. We even have self-driving cars, decentralized blockchain technology, and 3D printers that can construct complex three-dimensional objects from online blueprints. As a result of this tech boom, the subject of computer science has become a fascinating branch of learning. It has changed rapidly in a relatively short space of time and involves the study of computer systems, algorithms, data structures, computational problems, computer software applications, and computer hardware. Computer science can also lead to other areas like software engineering, data science, and data engineering.  Most computer science degrees include many hours of computer programming. This fundamental skill has growing importance in major sectors like finance, technology, manufacturing, and energy. However, youâ€™ll learn much more than just coding. Due to the broad nature of computer science degree programs, students can be flexible in their career goals.'

        desc: 'Before you switch careers, first things first: you should know the basic definition of computer code. Professional coders (also known as Software Engineers or Web Developers) write in a variety  of programming languages to create software, apps, and websites. All the  apps on your phone, the browser youâ€™re working on, your social media  feedâ€”itâ€™s all been brought to life with the help of code.  Similar to the way a cook follows a set of step-by-step instructions to create a  signature dish, computer code is a set of instructions  that guide software to perform a desired function. That should give you a good picture of what a coder does. Code can be as simple as a one-line instruction.  For example, below is a one-line code in Python that prints the text  â€˜Hello Worldâ€™: print Hello, World!  This is often the first lesson in coding tutorials. But it gets much more complex: code can go up to several hundred, even thousands, of lines. It may  even call upon and embed a series of other codes. This type of complex  coding is what goes on behind the apps we use day-in and day-out. Hereâ€™s another example: when  a widget on your phone describes the temperature and the humidity in your area, there are complex network interactions  taking place behind the scenes. A series of computer programs interact with satellite  servers and encode a request for the data, which is decoded by the  servers there that interpret the query and respond with the desired  data. This is again encrypted and decrypted from lines of code to an  output that you and I can understand. If youâ€™re feeling inspired, letâ€™s move on to the most important steps you need to take to become a coder.'

No matter what the industry, a stunning, easy-to-use, on-brand website plays a pivotal role in connecting and selling to customers. Talented front-end developers are responsible for everything you see and interact with online. They create sites and web apps that millions of people use every single day. It comes as no surprise that a career in front-end development offers some serious job security. The role is highly sought-after and aspiring developers can expect a lucrative compensation package. If you want to learn more about what a front-end professional does, read on. Letâ€™s start by exploring the difference between front-end and back-end web development.Front-End vs Back-End Developers : Front-end developers (also known as client-side developers) work on features that users can see and access. They usually come from a graphic design background and have skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, user interface (UI) design, and user experience (UX) design. Back-end developers (sometimes called server-side developers) are responsible for site functionality and background processes. Theyâ€™re technical professionals and masters of data and coding. PHP, Java, Python, SQL, and database design are common skills needed to become a back-end developer.'
